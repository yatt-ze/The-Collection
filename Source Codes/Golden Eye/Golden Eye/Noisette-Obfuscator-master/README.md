# Noisette - The nuts-breaker Obfuscator
**Noisette (nuts in French) is aimed to be an open-source C# Obfuscator for .NET assembly built with [dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib), WPF and my humble coding skills.** Noisette is the first .NET obfuscated meant to be a nuts-breaker for both the decompiler and the hacker.

## Download Noisette
You can download compiled version of Noisette for Windows XP and above from https://github.com/XenocodeRCE/Noisette-Obfuscator/releases.

The app is currently in its pre-release stage, so it contains bugs and error. Confirmed to be working on both C# and VB.NET target, as that's what the developers mostly code in.

## How do I test it?

</p>

Start **Noisette.exe**, drag and drop a .NET file on it, and magic should happen. It will create a "*%yourfile%_protected*" output in the same folder.

## What features does it have?
For the moment, only a few, if you want a really strong ready-to-use Obfuscator have a look at [NETGuard.io](http://netguard.io)
- Constant Outlinning
- Strings Outlinning
- Renaming
- Invalid Metadata Injection
